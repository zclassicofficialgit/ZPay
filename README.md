WARNING: Be careful when using this software! It is highly experimental. Always have your private keys saved securely. We STRONGLY recommend testing the wallet out on the testnet before using it for live transactions to familiarize yourself with its operation.

Always test with small amounts first! It is your responsibility to properly handle your private keys.
For best security, it is recommended to build the entire ZPay wallet by yourself, directly from GitHub.

Encryption: Wallet encryption is currently disabled by Zclassicd. You should use full-disk encryption (or encryption of your home directory) to protect your wallet.dat file, and should assume that even unprivileged users who are running on your O/S can read your wallet.dat file.
